    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <button class="accordion">What is Kotlin Multi Platform ?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>
            Kotlin Multiplatform is a versatile development framework allowing developers to write code that runs
            seamlessly across multiple platforms, including Android, iOS, web, and desktop. Leveraging Kotlin's concise
            syntax and interoperability with Java, developers can share business logic, data models, and other
            non-platform-specific code across different environments, reducing redundancy and speeding up development
            cycles. This approach promotes code reuse and maintainability, streamlining the creation of cross-platform
            applications. With Kotlin Multiplatform, developers can efficiently target various platforms while
            maintaining a single codebase, enabling faster iteration and greater flexibility in software development.

    <button class="accordion">What is the difference between Cross & Native Platform ?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>
            Cross-platform development refers to the creation of software applications that can run seamlessly on
            multiple operating systems, such as iOS, Android, and Windows, using a single codebase. This approach offers
            advantages in terms of cost-effectiveness and time efficiency, as developers can write code once and deploy
            it across various platforms. On the other hand, native platform development involves building applications
            specifically tailored to a particular operating system using its native programming languages and tools.
            While native apps often deliver superior performance and user experience due to their optimized integration
            with the platform, they require separate development efforts for each targeted platform, which can be
            resource-intensive.

    <button class="accordion">What is Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) ?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>
            Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the meticulous process of enhancing a website's visibility in search
            engine results pages (SERPs) through organic means. This involves optimizing various on-page factors such as
            meta tags, headings, and keyword density, as well as off-page elements like backlinks and social signals.
            Technical SEO aspects such as site structure, XML sitemaps, and schema markup play a crucial role in
            improving crawlability and indexation by search engine bots. Additionally, strategic keyword research,
            competitor analysis, and continuous performance tracking through analytics tools are imperative for
            effective SEO campaigns. Ultimately, mastering SEO requires a blend of technical expertise, analytical
            insight, and consistent optimization efforts to achieve higher rankings and organic traffic.

    <button class="accordion">What is MERN Stack Development ?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>
            MERN Stack development leverages MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js to create robust, scalable web
            applications. MongoDB, a NoSQL database, offers flexibility in data storage, while Express.js facilitates
            building server-side applications with ease. React.js, a powerful JavaScript library, enables the creation
            of dynamic user interfaces, ensuring a seamless user experience. Node.js serves as the runtime environment,
            allowing server-side execution of JavaScript code. Together, these technologies form a cohesive stack,
            empowering developers to craft feature-rich applications with efficient data handling, real-time updates,
            and smooth client-server communication, thus driving innovation in modern web development.
